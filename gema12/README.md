# Inery Testnet Task 4

This repository contains a solution for Task 4 of the Inery testnet, which requires the development of a software solution for the remote procedure call of the push_transaction blockchain's API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

$ git clone https://github.com/inery-blockchain/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks.git



2. Navigate to the `task4` branch:
$ cd inery-testnet-faucet-tasks
$ git checkout task4


3. Create a new directory named after your account name on the Inery blockchain and copy the code solution from the previous step into a new file named `Main.vb` in that directory.

4. Replace `"your-private-key"` in `Main.vb` with your actual private key.

5. Compile and run the solution using Visual Studio or the command line:

$ vbc Main.vb

$ ./Main.exe



6. If the solution passes validation and testing, you will be approved for completion of the Inery testnet Task 4.

## Built With
