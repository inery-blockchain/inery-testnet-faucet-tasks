## HOW TO RUN SCRIPT

To run this script, you need to have python installed on your computer. You can check if 
python is already installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing python. If it's installed, you should see something like Python 3.x.x.

### 1. Step One 
Save the script to a file with a ```.py``` extension, for example ```dandidce_task4.py```.

### 2. Step two
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved.

### 3. Step Three
Set the value of the private_key variable with the environment variable

### 4. Step Four
Type python dandidce_task4.py and press enter.
If everything is set correctly, the script should run and perform the transaction specified in the script.
Note that you need to set the url variable with a url that is reachable and have the private_key variable set with a private key that have permissions to perform the transaction.
