# The code tutorial you have provided explains how to set up and run a project that uses NodeJS, NPM, and Git.
The project is located on Github and can be cloned by using the command git
 ```
clone https://github.com/madhouse/inery-testnet-faucet-tasks -b task4.
```

Before running the project, the following dependencies need to be installed on your system:

```NodeJS: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables you to run server-side code.
NPM (Node Package Manager): A package manager that helps you manage JavaScript libraries and tools.
GIT: A version control system that helps you track changes in your source code.
To install these dependencies, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

javascript
Copy code
curl http://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt install git nodejs -y
The first command adds the NodeJS package repository to your system, while the second command installs Git and NodeJS.

After cloning the repository, you need to set the environment variables in the .env file. These variables are:

NODE_IP_INERY="http://35.240.149.168:8888": The URL of your node.
PRIVATE_KEY: Your private key.
ACCOUNT_INERY: Your Inery account.
DATA_TX_PUSH: Your data ID (numeric only).
You can edit the file by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
cd inery-testnet-faucet-tasks/madhouse
nano .env
To install the required modules for the project, you need to run the following commands in your terminal:

Copy code
npm install -g npm
npm install
The first command upgrades your NPM version to the latest, while the second command installs the dependencies specified in the package.json file.

Finally, to run the script, you can use the following command in your terminal:

perl
Copy code
npm run push-transaction```
