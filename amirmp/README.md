```shell
First of all, if you want to run your dapp via localhost you need to create an .env file containing your private key. If you plan to run your dapp on non-custom hosts, add your .env file as an ENVIRONMENT and do not share your private key with anyone.
```

# 1. Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

# 2. Run project (local host)

```shell
npm run dev
```

# 3. Build 

```shell
npm run build
```

# Link to dapp

```shell
https://task5-amirmp.vercel.app
```
