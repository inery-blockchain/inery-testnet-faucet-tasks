# Run the DAPP locally

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

# Demo app
[Demo app](https://sunnyduong.vercel.app/)

## Change directory to sunnyduong and install dependency

```bash
cd sunnyduong/
```

```bash
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've change a directory and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```
